# pyioas: Python Intelligent Optimization Algorithms

---

This repository implements some of the intelligent optimization algorithms that I have seen or used during my graduate studies

# Progress

- 
- [x] Grey Wolf Optimizer
- [x] Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO): A new optimization algorithm based on generalized quadratic interpolation and its applications to real-world engineering problems
- [x] Artificial hummingbird algorithm: A new bio-inspired optimizer with its engineering applications
